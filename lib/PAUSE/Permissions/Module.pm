=head1 NAME

PAUSE::Permissions::Module - PAUSE permissions for one module (from 06perms.txt)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PAUSE::Permissions::Module;

 my %options =
    (
     m => 'LINC',
     f => 'P5P,
     c => ['NEILB'],
    );
  
 my $mp = PAUSE::Permissions::Module->new( %options );
 
 print "owner = ", $mp->owner, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PAUSE::Permissions::Module is a data class, an instance of which is returned
by the C<module_permissions()> method in L<PAUSE::Permissions>.
It's not expected that you'll instantiate this module yourself,
but you're probably reading this to find out what methods are supported.

=head1 METHODS

To understand the three levels of PAUSE permissions, see L<PAUSE::Permissions/"The 06params.txt file">.

=head2 owner 

Returns a single PAUSE id, or C<undef>.

=head2 co_maintainers

Returns a list of PAUSE ids,
which will be empty if the module doesn't have any co-maintainers.
The list will be sorted alphabetically.

B<Note:> if a module has both an 'm' permission and an 'f' permission,
then the user with the 'f' permission will included in the list returned by C<co_maintainers()>,
because PAUSE treats them as a co-maintainer.

=head2 registered_maintainer

Returns the PAUSE id of the registered maintainer of the module (the 'm' permission),
or C<undef> if there isn't one defined for the module.

=head2 first_come

Returns the PAUSE id of the 'first uploader' for the module (the 'f' permission),
or C<undef> if there isn't one defined for the module.

=head2 all_maintainers

Returns the PAUSE id of all users who have permissions for this module,
in alphabetical order.
