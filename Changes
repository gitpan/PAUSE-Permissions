Revision history for Perl module PAUSE::Permissions

0.06 2013-12-04
    - added module_iterator() method on PAUSE::Permissions,
      which returns an iterator that will loop over 06perms.txt
      returning an instance of PAUSE::Permissions::Module each
      time it's called.

    - switched to Moo
    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES - simplifying things:
        + merged public 'filename' and private '_path' into 'path'.
          If you pass to the constructor, it's where we'll read from,
          other we'll set it based on File::HomeDir->my_dist_data
        + changed 'uri' to 'url', because that's more accurate
        + dropped the 'cachedir' parameter
      Thanks to DAGOLDEN for the suggestions.
    - Added method entry_iterator() which returns an instance of
      PAUSE::Permissions::EntryIterator. Iterates over the whole file.
    - switched from [GitHub::Meta] to [GithubMeta] in dist.ini
